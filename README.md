# Real-Time WebSocket Chat Server


## Overview

This is a high-performance, real-time WebSocket chat server built using **uWebSockets** and **nlohmann::json** and written in C++.
The architecture is designed to be modular, low-footprint, and easily extendable.


---

## Features

- **Multi-channel, multi-room support**: Users can join different channels and rooms. Messages are scoped to the room they belong to.
- **Validations**: Messages are validated for size and schema before reaching further.
- **Rate limiting**: Users are limited to 5 messages per second to prevent spam. Excessive violations result in automatic disconnection.
- **Message history**: Keeps the last 50 messages per room for users joining late.
- **Real-time messaging**: Broadcast messages are sent to all participants in a room instantly.
- **JSON-based communication**: All client-server messages use JSON with strict schema validation.
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGINT handling closes all connections cleanly.
- **Modular code structure**: Divided into headers and implementation for maintainability and scalability.
- **Logging**: Logs key events including connections, disconnections, rate-limit violations, and errors.
